# swing-breaker
This is a simple implementation of the game Brick Breaker using Swing and AWT.

In my first introductory computer science class, CS106A, our third assignment was to implement the game Breakout (Brick Breaker) in Java. However, as we were just being introduced to programming, we used our school's Java libraries that made everything much more accessible and easy to manage.

This is my attempt at trying to recreate that game now that I (to put it in terms of my former self) "know some real Java." This is the first game I've implemented using these libraries, so there's still a bit of a learning curve there to overcome, regardless of how simple the game is.
